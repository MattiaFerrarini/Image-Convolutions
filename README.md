## Quickstart
To get started, simply follow the steps in the 'Settings' panels:

1) Upload the image you'd like to work with;
2) Choose the size of the filter(kernel) you'd like to apply;
3) Create your filter: choose one of the possible values and assign it to kernel elements (the cells of the matrix) by clicking on them or dragging you cursor across them while holding the left mouse button down.

Some common filters have been provided in 'Example filters'.
